# 183DA_LAB2
#Musical Instrument_Buzzer_End 

The main idea of this lab was to build an electromechanical musical band driven by ESP8266 micro-controller with the use of sensors and 
actuators. The band was then required to be functional both in autonomous and human-controlled modes. It would be commanded through an # 
internet-based web interface. The band would also have interaction with sensors to to analyse and measure the state and would respond to # 
possible changes using actuators.
